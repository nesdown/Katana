What is Katana?
---------------
Katana is a new decision in question of making Twitter bots for info agregating, messages writing, posting pictures and lots more. In common, the main project's part is a script written with Python containing all the functions you may need including finding images, writing post text, making translations etc.

- already configured set of Twitter data (including app-tokens and API functions) to make the bot work properly
- automated system for finding pictures via Bing Search and getting them on a hard drive full-sized
- connected translation library for work with information given in different languages

Instructions

Read this step-by-step tutorial with code explanations. Also, take a look at project examples in 'Bots Examples' folder. 

Launch
------
Type next command from project's directory:
