What is Katana?
---------------
Katana is a new decision in question of making Twitter bots for info agregating, messages writing, posting pictures and lots more. In common, the main project's part is a script written with Python containing all the functions you may need including finding images, writing post text, making translations etc.

Features
--------
- functions for work with an array of websites and collecting information from them
- already configured set of Twitter data (including app-tokens and API functions) to make the bot work properly
- automated system for finding pictures via Bing Search and getting them on a hard drive full-sized
- connected translation library for work with information given in different languages

Launch
------
Type next command from project's directory:

$ sudo nohup python script.py &

You can stop terminal session after that - the script will work in background mode

Why 'Katana'?
-------------
Because this technology cuts web-scrapped data into parts just like a sharp sword.
